These files make the ups product python_future_six_request in all its multi-lingual glory.

To make a single flavor:

make clean && make && . ups_sourceme.sh && setup curl && make the_rest

This will result in a ups product directory (sl6_ups or sl7_ups) containing
a python_future_six_request product matching up to the python version /bin/env
finds and the ups flavor of the OS the makefile was executed on.

To make additional flavors after the first flavor:

setup python (new_desired_flavor)
make && make the_rest
