REST API application server for JobSub

################
# Development
################

We use pip  and virtual env to manage dependencies

Initial Setup
1.  Open command prompt and navigate to this directory
2.  chmod 700 dev_initial_setup.sh
3.  ./dev_initial_setup.sh
4.  source dev_use_virtual_env.sh

Every time you do a git pull you should install all
new pip dependencies
1.  source dev_use_virtual_env.sh


################
# Configuration
################

Apache mod_wsgi is set up to run the cherry.py application as a daemon so that jobs
can be started as a user other than apache. The jobsub environment should be set up
in the .bashrc of the user by adding the following commands:

source /fnal/ups/etc/setups.sh
setup jobsub_tools
